# Toucan-IDS (Forked for Study)

## Purpose
This repository was forked to study the structure and implementation of a full-featured Intrusion Detection System (IDS).  
It served as a reference point while I developed my own simplified IDS prototype for my MCA program.

## My Learning
- Explored how IDS projects are organized in open-source repositories.  
- Understood concepts like network monitoring, threat detection, and logging systems.  
- Practiced GitHub workflows: forking, editing, committing, and documenting.  
- Compared a full-featured IDS with my own simplified version to understand scalability.

## Notes
This fork is maintained only for study and comparison purposes.  
All personal contributions and documentation are available in my customized repository linked above.
